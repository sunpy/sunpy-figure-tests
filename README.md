# sunpy-figure-tests
A repository to store figures generated by the figure tests.

How to generate the conda_env file:

```bash
conda list > conda_env
```

How to generate the hash figures
```bash
py.test sunpy/map/tests/test_mapbase.py
```

That will produce an output with the path for the figures and 
hashes to substitute the figures and hashes of this repository.
